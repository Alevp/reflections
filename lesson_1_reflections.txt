How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It helps, because we can focus only on the lines that change, so we can see
    the error faster than searching in the whole document

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    If we make some changes that are not useful, we can always  return to
    previous version

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    When we have to do commits manually, we can choose when is the appropriate
    time to do it.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because they have a different purpose, Google Docs manages files, photos
    and things that don't need to be related. However Git is designed for
    programming where it is common manage multiples files at once.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

	To use git log, we have to go to the path where is our project and then
	type "git log" in the gitbash
    To use git diff, we have to go to the path where is our project and then
    type "git diff idnewfile idoldfile" in the gitbash

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    It makes me more confident, because with checkout command I can check
    previous version of the code.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Not sure yet
