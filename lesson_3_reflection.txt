When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    In a group project, or when I don't want to work in a one machine.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because I can choose when the changes are really significant for the 
    project.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

   Forks is a feature of GitHub, and allow us to copy a repository into our
   account in GitHub. A fork has a linking back to the original repository, 
   and also makes easy to suggest things to the original repository.
   
   Clones are an exact copy of a repository.

   Branches are useful when you want to try new features without affecting 
   the main code.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
